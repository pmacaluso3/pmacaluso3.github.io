I want to take a look at a few attitudes that have popped up more than twice this week that I want to transform into... well, other attitudes. My penchant for going no-frills is going to slowly evolve into proficiency as a master frilleur. I was the sort of kid who, when assigned a poster project in middle school, would bring in a posterboard with several paragraphs of 12-point Times New Roman text on it. It was really good text, but that mindset has got to go. The Pete of the Future (tm) will be unafraid to brand himself and put that brand (and all his other opinions on the world of tech) out there. </p>

Ok, nuts and bolts from this week. During my younger years full of video games, I would always save my game before any big decision that I thought might turn out to be irrevocable. The downside to this was, what if I later learned that I made a mistake several decisions ago? Because I am a dinosaur, I played mostly SNES games, most of which only gave you one spot in which you could save, and were therefore really bad for my strategy of saving constantly. But aha! then there came the Playstation. On Playstation games, you could save to different files of your memory card and create as many different save files (at different points in the game) as you wanted. Suffice to say that my FF7 play was much more optimized than my Chrono Trigger play. Why am I rambling about this? Because it turns out that the world of developers thinks a lot like The Pete of the Past (tm) did. If you're writing some code, you will probably come to a decision point: (super simplified example) Should I use a while loop or a for loop here? Let's say you go with the while loop, and then you make another big decision, and then another, and then another, and then... CHRIST you realize that you should have just used the for loop. You are going to have to undo all the changes you've made since the part when you decided on the while loop, or maybe even worse, you may have screwed up so badly that you have to start over. But belay that torrent of curse words that you are surely about to emit! Version control has come to the rescue. If you used version control (and used it the way it's intended), you would have saved a different version of your work before each of those big decisions. Simply pick out the version right before the part where you used the wrong loop, and you're good to work from there.

This is all pretty swell, but if you've ever used gooogle docs, you're already thinking that all of this could be done online to allow for collaboration and dissemination of your super awesome project that you've been working on. Enter GitHub, which is basically a website that lets you store all your versions of your project where anyone (well, anyone within the privacy limits that you set) can check it out. Using the example above, let's say that I wrote my code using a for loop, and it worked fine, but then I share it publicly on GitHub. You take a look at it, notice my judicious choice of loop, and wonder if maybe there's a better way to accomplish this task somewhere out there. One way to go about this would be to step right into my project, delete out the part that you think could be improved upon, and replace it with your fancy pants idea. Your idea may be the bomb, or it may be less-than-the-bomb, but either way, what I've just described would be considered by most to be a "dick move" (standard industry term). A much less dickish move would be to say: Hey bro, you've got some cool code there, but lemme propose an improvement. Would it be helpful for me to just go ahead and insert it? Not really, because no one is perfect and the code might introduce a bug. Would it be helpful for me to describe to ou the change I want you to make? Not really: if you've got a good idea, you should go ahead and take a crack at implementing it yourself. So maybe I can make my own copy of yours, edit THAT, and then show you what the new and improved version can do. This process is exactly what GitHub lets users do. I can copy someone else's code (again, if they've allowed this through their privacy setting management); this copying process is called forking. But the forked copy still only exists on GitHub.com as opposed to on my own machine; to bring it to my own machine, I have to copy the copy (?!?) from the remote location to the local computer. This is called cloning. Then, I can edit my clone and propose the changes to the original author. If the author likes the changes, he or she can absorb them into the original ("pull").

<p>It sounds complicated, but I figured it out in under a week (with some helpful guidance, of course). Welcome to The Future (not-tm).
