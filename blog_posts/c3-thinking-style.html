    Many years ago, a much younger version of myself took a battery of quizzes about learning styles and personality types. Among other things, they revealed that this young Pete was Introverted-iNtuitive-Thinking-Judging, a primarily auditory/vocal learner, an abstract-random thinker, and a Sagittarius. About a month later, a slightly older Pete took the same quizzes over again, and they revealed that he was now Extroverted-iNtuitive-Feeling-Perceiving, a primarily verbal/kinesthetic learner, a concrete-random thinker, and... still a Sagittarius.

    The Pete of the Present (and for that matter, the Pete of all the time in between many-years-ago and now) does not put a ton of stock in diagnoses of personality or how one thinks. I'm not saying "bah humbug," but I do think that one can sink a ton of energy into trying to define yourself rather than just being yourself.

    The Pete of the Present also happens to be involved in the mighty challenge of learning web development in 19 weeks, and in the even mightier challenge of exploring his own ways of thinking and learning. Here's what I'm trying to keep in sight as I undergo this journey: alphabet soup is not as important as my own knowledge of my own self, because I am constantly changing and so is my perception of the world.

    So far, Phase 0 has been pretty straightforward. The expectations are clear and laid out on the table, and I've got an excellent cohort of co-learners surrounding me (not to mention the entire internet) I can consult when I'm stuck on something. The question I have for myself is: am I going to let this current impression set the tone for the rest of my DBC experience? I think that would be a serious mistake. But I have come to believe that it's much harder to attempt to avoid something than to attempt to replace it with some other behaviour that you <em>do</em> positively want to do, so: I seek to reboot my entire attitude at the end of every 3 week period (starting right now) of DBC. I hereby throw out every clinging attitude that I've picked up since the start of the program, and I'm ready to treat tomorrow like the first day of camp.
