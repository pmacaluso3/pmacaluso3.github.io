      Through Phase 0, my usual neuroticism has shaped the way I've asked questions. I'm very vigilant against asking something that has already been asked, or that I should have been able to find myself. I like to think that this is one of the ways in which a little self-consciousness can be harnessed for a useful cause. My point in talking about this is to say that I haven't asked the google+ community for my cohort a lot of technical questions, but rather just gone to the tubes to find the answers.
    </p>

      I have, however, come up with some conjectures based on the pairing invitations I've posted and the types of responses they've gotten, as well as the types of pairing requests I've responded to. I think that with a little extrapolation, the tidbits from these questions can be extended to technical questions (for the day in the murky future when I actually ask one of those).
    </p>
    <p>
      The posts that I thought might receive responses the quickest were the ones like: "I'm looking to do any of this week's pair challenges at any time." Jeez, wide open! Take your pick! What could possibly be more accessible? Nope. Those requests got the weakest response. I guess I'm just rediscovering something every salesperson already knows: you have to paint a very specific picture if you want to get anyone's attention. Details are key. Vaguery, even though well-intended to give people plenty of options, never does that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The requests that got responses most easily? "I'm looking to do challenge x at time y." No windows, no alternatives offered. Ok, how does this extend into technical question asking? I'm going to synthesize my response from the aforementioned experiences as well as question asking guidelines I've read on Coursera classes, stackoverflow critiques, and this class itself.

          Explain how to reproduce the issue you found. In the course of rehearsing how to encounter the problem you encountered, there's a really good chance you'll stumble onto the answer. Plus, the odds of someone else taking the time to do that research for you are very low. So copy the code that generated the error or didn't do what you expected into the question.
        </li>
        <li>
          Include what your code spat out in the question, and why you think it should have returned something else. There's always a chance that it's working exactly as intended, and your expectation for what it should do was off. Some kind mentor is more likely to explain why it's doing what it's doing than to explain how it works from square 1.
        </li>
        <li>
          Value the time and energy of the person reading your question. You can tell when someone has taken a minute to compress their question into something pithy. You can also tell when someone has bothered to spell things correctly and use correct grammar. Everyone prefers helping people who help themselves, so show the world that you did your share of the legwork.
