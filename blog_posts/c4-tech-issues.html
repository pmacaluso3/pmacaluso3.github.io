  <p>
    For about a year now, the debate over net neutrality has been rising from a steady simmer to a rolling boil. What is this debate about exactly? It makes most sense to me to think of it with a little historical perspective. Imagine the U.S. around the turn of the 20th century, when the invention of the telephone was changing the way people communicated. The impact on the individual was game-changing, but the impact on business and industry was exponentially greater. If you were in the widgets business, and your competitors could place their orders and make their sales via the telephone while you were using the pony express, you were... what's the word?... screwed. You were living days behind the competition, who knew everything about the market before you did.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ok, that's a pretty compelling case to get on board with the telephone revolution (and for the continuity of this analogy, the same thing happened to every business that at first dug in its heels and said Bah Humbug when the world wide web was taking off in the early 1990s). But imagine now, dear reader, that you've decided that the world must change and you must change with it, so you request to have a new fangled telephone installed in your factory, only to be told that the telephone company has decided to raise its rates to prohibitively high levels because... well, because they like money and because they can. In fact, they're going to do what pretty much any type of business is allowed to do in a capitalist market: practice price discrimination for their consumers. Bigger businesses that consume phone service by the truckload can get a volume discount, while small fish have to pay full retail.
  </p>
  <p>
    I guess it doesn't sound THAT unfair when you put it that way, except... this isn't just any old service you might choose to buy as a business. This is the new normal, this is what industry will live and die by for the rest of the world as we know it (well, until the internet comes around, but we're not psychics here). If you're getting throttled on your phone bill, you can't compete in this brave new world.
  </p>
  <p>
    So the fed (more specifically, the FCC) had an interesting decision here. They could step in and say that the phone companies couldn't practice price discrimination, but wouldn't that be anti-capitalist, anti-competition, anti-American? Maybe a little bit, but by pulling the trigger on this one and enforing uniform pricing for phone service, they allowed competition to flourish in every other sector of industry. They effectively said that phone service is so fundamental to the world as it's going to be from here on out that we have to treat it differently from any other service.
  </p>
  <p>
    Side note: Don't go crying for the phone (or internet) companies, they make boatloads. Another side note: I personally think it's very lucky that no technological developments on the scale of the phone or the internet came about during the Cold War, a time when anything could happen, no matter how insane, if you hinted that the alternative was anti-American.
  </p>
  <p>
    With that analogy wrapped up, it's been on the table for about the past 10 years that maybe the internet has to be treated the same way that phone service has come to be treated. It's been debated really hotly for over a year now, and while I don't claim to know the legal ins-and-outs of it, I would put my money on: the big internet companies would like to be able to price discriminate to their hearts' content, and some big businesses are on board with this, since they would be getting the volume discounts. Meanwhile, everyone else would like to avoid getting crippled.
  </p>
  <p>
    About a month ago, the FCC finally carried the measure that is proported to be the end of the issue, making internet service a discrimination-proof service. This is a big step forward for internet rights, and I'm hoping that the issue never comes up to a boil again. Let's say I'm very guardedly optimistic.
