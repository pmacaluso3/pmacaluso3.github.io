    I didn't move to Chicago just for Dev Bootcamp. It actually wasn't on my radar at all until I had already been here for 5 months. The reason I moved here at first was simply to get away from my home town and live in an exciting big city.
  </p>
  <p>
    The conflict in this decision was mostly between me and my dad. I love my dad, and he's probably the single person in the world I want to make proud the most. But he was not happy that I wanted to move away from Tampa, where he'd lived his entire life. I displaced onto him the reason that my mom didn't want me to move away, which was that she just wanted me to be nearby. That's a pretty good reason, and I could see any parent feeling that way, so it just made sense to me that that's what dad was thinking too.
  </p>
  <p>
    I stumbled onto the real reason by accident. He was asking me to explain why I thought this was a good idea. I gave him my reasons and he gave me his responses. "There aren't a lot of STEM jobs in Tampa." "OK, but you've got one." "True, but I want to have some mobility. I also want to be around more people my age. It's not as easy as it should be to meet people and make friends." "You have friends here, don't you?" "Yes, but only a few. And they're mostly from work. And I want to be around people who are more progressive."
  </p>
  <p>
    Dad's reaction to that was very different. He got distressed, and anger boiled over onto the surface. I wasn't expecting that at all, and we put the discussion on hold until we had both cooled down. When I dissected this later, I realized that I had misunderstood what dad was feeling. He wasn't upset that I wouldn't be around, he felt that I was saying that his hometown, where he had spent his entire life and made his friends and livelihood, wasn't good enough for me. Did I really feel that way? I'm really ashamed to admit that I did, and still do. I'm not ashamed because I feel loyalty to that city, I'm ashamed because I know that this feeling hurts my dad, and yet I feel it anyway.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even though I still don't feel the way I want to, I figured out that I needed to be honest with dad. I told him that I did want my life to be bigger than Tampa. It hurt both of us, but once it was out in the open we could move past it.
