    With a small handful of pairing sessions in the books, here are some of my thoughts on the pros and the cons of the system. It's more fun to have someone to joke around with other than myself, because I already know all my jokes and I'm tired of them. Even if I spent all kinds of time exploring articles on the topic du jour, I wouldn't have the creative branching out that I've gotten by having other people show me cool posts they've found. The aspects of pairing that I've found less-than-stellar are the speed drop and the driver-navigator system. My partners and I have almost every time found that we could have gotten the challenge done more quickly if we just shut up and typed rather than discuss every decision; in the future, I'm going to propose in my sessions that we either give the problem a first brush on our own before the hour, or spend part of the hour doing so. I think it would add more to the refactoring and discussion parts if we had both already come to an understanding of the basics on our own. As for the driver-navigator system, I think it'll fall into place better with more difficult challenges, i.e., challenges with enough research to keep the navigator busy. Alternatively, on challenges that are tough enough to have a more abstract component, I think the navigator will be able to contribute more by looking at things from a step back. In these challenges though, the navigator didn't have as much to do.

    Feedback, on the other hand, is a little bit more familiar territory for me. I've written and received feedback as part of some past jobs, so I've gotten over the initial phase of squeamishness in which I wasn't willing to be constructive or to read the constructive comments of others. Look, it's not that big a deal, it's not scary. I have lots of things I could be doing better. And I have lots of things that I do intentionally that people have pointed out they weren't fans of; some of them I've stopped doing, some of them I continue to do because that's just me. For example, I know I can be a little pedantic, and I know I can do too much of the talking. I continue to be that way, not because I can justify that the universe is a better place because of it, but because that's just how I am. I own it. And because I own it, it's a lot easier to be sensitive to how it's impacting someone else and to tell myself, Now isn't the right time for that.

    Basically, I'm just not afraid to get criticized or to criticize. I think I definitely used to be afraid of both in the past, but experience has desensitized me in a healthy way.
