I want to use this post to synthesize some of my bigger takeaways from Shereef's kitchen-and-table chat with some of the things I've heard from the would outside of DBC when I've mentioned that I'm going into it.

I used to be a high school teacher, and something I figured out pretty soon was that the expectations I had of myself when I was a student were very different from the expectations my students had for themselves. I was always pretty sure I would be fine come test-time if I knew the material thoroughly. That was my MO for all of my school career. Imagine my surprise to learn that kids just want to know what's going to be on the test (?!?!). I'm bringing this up because it's the crux of the difference between an own-this-experience and a get-owned-by-this-experience. This is the clearest, most encapsulating explanation I can give. When you know you're in control, you're not in struggle-to-survive mode. At the head of the classroom, I experimented with different policing techniques to get my kids to worry about understanding rather than performance. We had a list of no-no phrases and attitudes for a while: basically a thesaurus of different ways to ask whether this was going to be on the test. That was a pretty long experiment that mostly didn't yield any awesome results, except for the knowledge that you can't police anyone into having fun and really getting into a topic. What I did figure out is that the decision to get into something comes from within the student, and the only way in which the teacher has control over this variable is to just be excited and enthusiastic as hell.

That gets me into the next point I want to think about: as far as I can see, and based on what I've heard from DBC prospective students, alums, current students, and even dropouts, DBC is some part cult. I don't mean that we're all going to traverse the galaxy together after we drink the magic potion, I mean that no one disagrees that there's a very particular culture you have to buy into as part of the experience. I've talked to more than a few people who agree that they'd rather just learn to code with their own attitude; why is it sooooo imperative that I think about coding the same way you do, after all? I can dig this, but I've definitely had times in my life when an unhealthy attitude has held me back, and in hindsight, I could have broken through some obstacles in my life much more easily if I had had a different attitude. So I buy that having guidance in how you're going to approach a problem can be as important as having guidance in the technical aspects, it's just so... personal? invasive? to have someone tell you that you need to change the way you're thinking.
