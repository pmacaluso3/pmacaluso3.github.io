    ...and my misgivings about this approach
  </div>
  
  <p>
    I took a good honest look at what I value in my life and what I've valued in the past. Those two groups are very different from each other. I'd like to think that I'm in a more mature and stable place now than I was in the past, but I'm sure that the past me would have liked to think the same thing. So who's to say that I'm not just passing through another phase? I have a sneaking suspicion that that's all life is, a series of passing phases. I find that kinda comforting, because I prefer momentum and change to stagnation. For the record, of the values that I wrote down, the ones I think I can stand behind most strongly are meeting new people and going to new places.

    It's tough for me to link those (or the other values I wrote down: independence, working on a team, intellectual recognition) to my stereotype threat. I'm not even convinced that I belong to a group. I mean, white male. It's the anti-group. It's the non-group against which all other groups are compared. I don't feel like I have any reason or right to worry about what negative things people think of me. But I guess that when I think of white male, I think... whatever that guy's saying or doing is probably coming from a position of privilege and ignorance.

    Okay, so maybe my self-fulfilling prophecy is that I'm going to be just another unoriginal, unremarkable person. But there have totally been times when that has not been the case, and I've energized the people around me. There have actually been times when I was the dynamo of a group. What was it about those instances? Could it just be the fluke combination of personalities that existed there? I can't rule that out, but it felt like there was a common thread among those scenarios.

    I feel very distinctly, both in those times and in retrospect, that I was positively -un-aware of what people were thinking of me. And that's the root of my argument against stereotype threat awareness. I think that the best way to combat it is to act like it's not there. That's been my route to confidence and energy in the face of opposition, and based on the findings of the studies cited by Clauge Steele. Performance gaps appeared when students were reminded of which groups they belonged to, so shouldn't I be trying to forget my hangups about myself? Totally forgetting about it might take some strategies to trigger getting into a place of momentum, or to distract oneself from the nagging doubts. But I maintain that if you want to evade your doubts about yourself, you have to do just that: work around them. Maneuver cleverly. Create mental games that get you thinking about something positive and forgetting about your stereotype threat, not acknowledging and then dismissing it. This may not work for everyone, but it works for me, and I'd bet I'm not alone in this.
