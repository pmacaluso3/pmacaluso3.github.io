    I have some very unpopular views on this topic, and I'm going to share them in this. If you don't like reading unpopular views, or if you do like reading unpopular views for the purpose of arguing with the author, there are a lot of other blogs out there you can read.

    I used to work in a tutoring studio in South Shore. In the middle of the straight-up hood. When someone asks me, "What was the makeup of your students?" I can reply with 100% objectivity, "Black." That was just the way it was. Before that, I taught at a Catholic high school in Florida where the student body was 95% white. And all those kids, black and white, displayed the same spectrum of traits that human students display: some were studious and perseverant, most were disruptive and didn't want to be there. In short, they were all just kids. And in both groups, there were kids who (in my observation and judgment) were going to go on to study hard and crush it in life, and kids who had already given up on themselves. And they were in about the same proportion in both groups.

  <p>
    Let me pause and say that a lot of other unfair things will probably happen to those kids based on which group they came from, and this post isn't about addressing that. Several of the Catholic school kids who have no interest in learning or contributing to society are going to inherit their daddy's company and never be less-than-obscenely-wealthy. Several of those black kids will bust their asses and hold prestigious positions at institutions of higher learning, only to have the N word screamed at them some day on the train. None of that is ok, but it's also not the topic of this particular essay.

    This essay is about the differences I observed in those kids in terms of how they perceived themselves. There were kids who knew in their heart of hearts that they were going to make it in both groups. There were kids who knew the exact opposite in both groups. There are quantifiable statistical differences between the two groups, and we won't have a claim to being a developed society until we have eliminated those differences. But this essay is about how any one person can perceive himself or herself.

    At the end of the day, you can achieve whatever you want. There are some places in the world, and some spheres of industry, in which this isn't true. But in the developed world, and most especially in the field of web and software development, everyone has the requisite access to education. I'm priviliged to have good enough credit to take out a loan and attend DBC, but if I didn't, it would be on me to read through W3 and CodeSchool and teach myself. There are so many major contributors to the industry who have done just that. The statistics are unacceptable, but no one's forcing you to become a statistic. Beat the odds.

    I know that the first impression I make on people is one of lack of authority and underconfidence because of my height. It has been demonstrated that people automatically think this about short people. But that isn't going to matter when someone is looking at the projects in my Github and deciding whether to hire me.

    I know that as a white male, I'm going to be the de facto bad guy in every discussion on equality and forming a progressive society. Including this essay. You're thinking it right now: This guy is a prick and doesn't know how privileged his life is. I know that I'm going to be competing in this industry against very talented people of every background, race, income level, gender, orientation, etc. I know that this industry is maybe the truest meritocracy we've got going right now, and I'm proud to be a part of it for that reason.
